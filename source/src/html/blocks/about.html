                    My name is Yaroslav and I specialize in web developement that utilizes HTML, CSS, JS, and REACT etc. <br>
                    I am a highly motivated individual and eternal optimist dedicated to writing clear, concise, robust code that works. Striving to never stop learning and improving.
                    When I'm not coding, I am writing bolgs, reading, or picking up some new hands-on art project like photography. <br>
                    I like to have my perspective and belief systems challenged so that I see the world through new eyes.
